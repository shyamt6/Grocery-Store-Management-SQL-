Grocery Store Management (SQL Project)
Designed and implemented a relational database with 7 interconnected tables (suppliers, customers, employees, products, orders, and order details). Performed advanced SQL queries using joins, aggregations, and subqueries to analyze customer behavior, product performance, supplier contribution, sales trends, and employee efficiency. Derived key insights such as top customers, best-selling products, and monthly revenue patterns to simulate real-world retail operations.
